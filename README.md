Fraud Detection
Oasis Infobyte Internship – Data Analytics

📌 Project Overview
This project tackles the critical task of detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning. Fraud detection is a real-world, high-impact problem where accuracy, scalability, and speed are crucial.

🧠 Key Concepts & Challenges
Anomaly Detection: Find patterns that deviate significantly from normal.

Model Building: Train classifiers like:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Neural Networks (optional)

Feature Engineering: Create derived features to highlight suspicious behavior.

Scalability & Real-Time Relevance: Emphasize the need for scalable detection pipelines.

Evaluation: Use metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Develop an end-to-end fraud detection system.

Learn anomaly detection and evaluation techniques.

Understand the trade-offs in imbalanced classification problems.

📁 Tools Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
